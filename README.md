                                          âš¡ MYSQL Project WORLD LIFE EXPECTANCY


- This project analyze the global life expectancy trends from 2007 to 2022 across different countries, 
  recognizing its significance as a measure of a country's overall health and well-being.


 - This analysis will explore the relationship between life expectancy and factors like GDP, adult and infant mortality, 
  healthcare and education to determine their impact.

       
 - We will investigate the correlation between the country's status and life expectancy. Additionally, we will examine trends of life expectancy
 in relation to GDP. Furthermore, we will investigate the relationship between education and life expectancy, assessing whether schooling 
 has a positive or negative effect.
